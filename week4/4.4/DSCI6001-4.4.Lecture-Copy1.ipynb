    "\n",
    "Consider the rotation of a vector or matrix in $R^2$. Suppose a nonzero vector ${\\bf u} = [u_1~~u_2]$ is rotated counterclockwise through an angle $\\theta$ to produce ${\\bf v} = [v_1~~v_2]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the fact that $\\| {\\bf u} \\| = \\| {\\bf v} \\| = v$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_1 = v \\cos (\\phi + \\theta) = v (\\cos \\theta \\cos \\phi - \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi)$$\n",
    "$$v_2 = v \\sin (\\phi + \\theta) = v (\\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi - \\cos \\theta \\sin \\phi)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Described in the below diagram\n",

    "![](images/rotation-2d.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $\\cos \\phi = u_1/v$ and $\\sin \\phi = u_2/v$ yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_1 = u_1 \\cos \\theta - u_2 \\sin \\theta$$\n",
    "$$v_2 = u_1 \\sin \\theta + u_2 \\cos \\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix form:\n",

    "In other words, ${\\bf v} = {\\bf P u}$, where $\\bf P$ is called the _rotation matrix_ or rotator. Notice that $\\bf P$ is an orthogonal matrix because ${\\bf P}^T {\\bf P} = {\\bf I}.$ This means that if ${\\bf v} = {\\bf P u}$, then ${\\bf u} = {\\bf P}^T {\\bf v}$. If $\\bf P$ rotates a vector through an angle $\\theta$, the ${\\bf P}^T$ rotates then vector through an angle $\\theta$.\n",

    "##Rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotating vectors in $R^3$ around any one of the coordinate axes is similar. Suppose that ${\\bf v} = \\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\\\v_2\\\\v_3\\end{bmatrix}$ is obained by rotating ${\\bf u} = \\begin{bmatrix}u_1\\\\u_2\\\\u_3\\end{bmatrix}$ counterclockwise through an angle $\\theta$ around the $z$-axis. In this case, the third coordinate remains unaffected, i.e., $v_3 = u_3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the projection of $\\bf u$ onto $xy$-plane, ${\\bf u}_p = [u_1~~u_2~~0]$. As $\\bf u$ is rotated around $z$-axis by angle $\\theta$, the projection ${\\bf u}_p$ gets rotated around the origin by the same angle. Thus the problem is reduced to rotation in the $xy$-plane, and we already know how to do this. Therefore, this rotation can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{matrix} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta & 0 \\\\ \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{matrix} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{matrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ u_3 \\end{matrix} \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\bf v} = {\\bf P}_z {\\bf u}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, ${\\bf P}_z$ is the matrix that rotates vectors in $R^3$ counterclockwise aroung the $z$-axis through an angle $\\theta$. It is easy to verity that ${\\bf P}_z$ is on orthogonal matrix. Using similar arguments, we can derive orthogonal matrices that rotate vectors around the $x$-axis or aroung the $y$-axis.\n",

    "**Rotations in higher dimensions** are straightforward generalizations of rotations in $R^3$. **Any $n \\times n$ orthogonal matrix rotation** preserves the dimensionality of a $n$-dim matrix. and thus is thought of as a rotation in $R^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal property of rotations beyond the preservation of spatial relationships is that they always have an axis of rotation: meaning there is always one line in $R^n$ that is left undisturbed by the rotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given an arbitrary rotation matrix ${\\bf P}$, one can find the axis of rotation by solving the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\bf P x} = \\lambda {\\bf x}$, $\\lambda = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we want to find an eigenvector ${\\bf x}$ of $\\bf P$ with eigenvalue 1. Once we find such a vector, then we’ll have the corresponding axis of rotation. These two properties are synonymous and is a logical extension of the meaning of eigenvectors, which has been talked about extensively so far.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here the matrix $\\bf P$ is orthogonal, which means, for any vector $\\bf w$, $\\|{\\bf Pw} \\| = \\|{\\bf w}\\|$. Therefore ${\\bf P}$ is a matrix of rotation.\n",
