    "## TASK 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greatest common divisor (of three numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic interview question. Suppose we want to find the greatest common divisor between two numbers, meaning that we want to find the largest number that evenly divides both numbers at the same time. This number can be found using the ancient algorithm that considers two numbers, $a$ where $a$ is a quotient and $b$ where $b$ is a remainder. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = q_{0}*b + r_{0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b = q_{1}r_{0}+r_{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{0} = q_{2}r_{1}+r_{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vdots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_{N-1} = q_{N+1}r_{N}+0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the point that the last remainder hits $0$, the algorithm stops and returns the quotient. This quotient is ultimately the greatest common divisor. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decomposing our task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first step is to create a recursive algorithm that computes the gcd of only two numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write a new algorithm it helps to proceed in a set of simple steps:\n",
    "1) Outline the goal of the algorithm\n",
    "2) Work through the steps of the algorithm as you believe them to be\n",
    "3) Write out pseudocode describing those steps\n",
    "4) Walk through the pseudocode by hand and see if you obtain the expected result\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Find the **base case**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we know by definition what the base case is. It occurs when the last remainder $r_{N}$ goes to zero, leaving only the last nonzero remainder, $r_{N-1}$. This is the GCD, and so we return the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Find the **propagation case**\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of at least one step that returns the original function itself with some modified arguments. The arguments and base case should be modified such that the arguments definitely reach the base case. In the case of the GCD calculation we are looking for another GCD calculation, this time with the quotient as the remainder and the remainder being the remainder of the quotient and the last remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "One might write a recursive function that sums a list of numbers:"

Below we have provided a schema for printing the triangle, you need only figure out how to print out the numbers using recursion.\n",
