    "Consider a set of $k$ vectors $[{\\bf v}_1, {\\bf v}_2, ..., {\\bf v}_k]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. If the set is an orthogonal set. i.e. the vectors are mutually orthogonal to each other, and $k \\leq n$, then the vectors are linearly independent. Consider the condition for linear dependence: \n",
    "\n",

The **Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization** algorithm allows us to derive such an orthogonal/orthonormal set, given a set of linearly independent vectors.\n",

    "In order to calculate an **orthonormal basis** instead of an orthogonal basis we can **simply normalize the vectors in the orthogonal basis** i.e. normalize after the final step in the above procedure. Alternatively, we may also normalize the vector at each step in the above procedure. There is no difference in outcome.\n",
