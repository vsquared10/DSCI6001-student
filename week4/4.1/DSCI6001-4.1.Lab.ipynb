    "In general, plotting simple geometry with vectors in most languages is an onerous task. The only language actually built to do this is TiKz for LaTeX, examples of which can be looked at [here](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/tag/3d/). As TiKz is a language and a craft all by itself, we will not cover it.\n",

    "Many more high-quality math plots can be done with [MayaVi](http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/). You can get free demos for these and are entreated to explore these for yourself.\n",

    "Below we have provided a piece of code that plots planes, using three demonstration planes and points on those planes (see your notes). **Write a class in python that can plot any plane given a set of at least three points.** You can build it to take more than three, if you choose but you'll need at least three (if you take more than three, what do you have to check for?) all lying on the plane. You will probably need to refresh yourself on [cross products](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cross.html). \n"
