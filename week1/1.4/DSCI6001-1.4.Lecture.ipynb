    "\n",
    "Recall in the previous lecture our interest in matrix invertibility and achieving the inversion ${\\bf A}^{-1}$ of a given matrix ${\\bf A}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, there are several ways one can find ${\\bf A}^{-1}$, both computationally and by hand. We will introduce the first way today, Gauss-Jordan elimination. (Additional methods will also be introduced to you later)\n",

    "The basic principle of Gauss-Jordan emerges from the properties of matrices and the inverse itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\textbf{A} x = b$\n",

    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{A}^{-1}\\textbf{A} x = \\textbf{A}^{-1}b$\n",

    "This may seem trivial but the intuition of it becomes more clear if one remembers the properties of the identity.\n",

    "Recall that matrices do not have a transitive property.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if $\\textbf{A}^{-1}\\textbf{A} = \\textbf{I}$\n",

Ambient levels of certain hormones, body weight set point and basal metabolic rate play into this equation, but most people's body weight is reflective of this basic paradigm. Weight is lost by adjusting caloric intake to be slightly below that which is needed for maintenance and then applying regular exercise.\n",
