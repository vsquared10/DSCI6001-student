    "\n",
    "1. The most common example of a vector space is the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $R^n$, where every element (or vector) is represented by a set of $n$ real numbers. The scalars belong to real numbers, $R$. Vector addition is componentwise, and scalar multiplication multiplies each term individually (recall _axpy_ operations on vectors). \n",
    "$$\\\\$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The above example for $R^n$ is also applicable when the scalars belong to the set of complex numbers $C$ i.e. numbers of the form $z=x+iy$.\n",
    "$$\\\\$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For $n>0$, the set $P_n$ of polynomials of degree at most $n$ consists of all polynomials fo the form\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$f(t) = a_0 + a_1 t + a_2 t^2 + \\cdots + a_n t^n$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    where coefficients $a_i$'s and variable $t$ are real numbers. It is easy to verify that $P_n$ forms a vector space. The sum of two polynomials \n",

The zero polynomial (where all coefficients are zero) acts as zero vector, and $(-1)f$ acts as the negative of $f$, so axioms 4 and 5 are also satistied.\n",

To verify this, note that properties (a), (b) and (c) are axioms 4, 1, and 6. Axioms 2, 3 and 7-10 are automatically true in $W$ because they apply to all elements of $V$, including those in $W$. Axiom 5 is also true in $W$ becuase if $\\bf x$ is in $W$, then $(-1){\\bf x}$ is in $W$ by property (c)."

Thus $W$ is a subspace of $R^3$.\n",

If the set of vectors that span a vector space is infinte, then the vector space is said to be of _infinite dimension_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",

    "1. The $n$-dimensional coordinate space $R^n$ is an example of a finite dimensional space. Why? Because the basis set that spans the space has exactly $n$ elements (or unit vectors in the most basic form).\n",
    "2. For the set of polynomials, if the degree of the polynomials is not limited, the dimension of $V$ is _infinite_ (or more precisely _countably infinite_). Why? Because any basis that consists of polynomials up to degree $n$ cannot represent a polynomial of degree $(n+1)$, or greater. Hence we need an infinite dimensional basis to represent a vector space consisting of polynomials when the degree of the polynomials are unrestricted."

    "__Translation__ is an operation that moves every point, or vector, by a constant factor in a particular direction. In vector algebra, _translating_ a vector is the same as adding a constant vector to it. The translation of a vector $\\bf v$ by a constant vector $\\bf t$ is represented as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Clearly, translation doesn't obey the additivity and homegeneity properties of linear transforms. Linear transforms combined with translation form an important class of transformations, called __affine transforms__, that are widely used in engineering and graphics applications. "

    "### Translation using matrix algebra\n",

    "In order to perform translation using matrix algebra, and to combine it with other linear transforms, we use the _homogeneous coordinate_ representation of vectors. A vector ${\\bf v} = [x\\ y]^T$ in $R^2$ is represented in homogeneous coordinates as ${\\bf v} = [x\\ y\\ 1]^T$, which allows us to create a (purely) translation mapping matrix as:\n",
