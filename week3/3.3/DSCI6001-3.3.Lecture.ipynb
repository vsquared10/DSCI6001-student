    "It can also be described as the solution of a set of linear homogeneous equations $A\\vec{x} = b$ where $b=0$. \n",

    "We can more generally think of the nullspace as an eigenspace where all the vectors map to $\\lambda = 0$. The kernel obeys all properties of an eigenspace, in that it remains closed under multiplication and addition, and is in all ways a proper vector space. \n",

This means that the information contained in this region of the domain is effectively preserved. In a very real sense, the image is the opposite of the kernel.
